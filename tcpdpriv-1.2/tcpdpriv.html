<h1>
<em>TCPDPRIV</em>
</h1>

<dt>
<b>Description</b>
<dd>
<em>Tcpdpriv</em> is program for eliminating confidential information
from packets collected on a network interface (or,
from trace files created using the <b>-w</b> argument to
<a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpdump.tar.Z><em>tcpdump</em></a>).
<dt>
<b>Requirements</b>
<dd>
Tcpdpriv is fairly modest in its requirements.  It does, however,
require the <a href=ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z><em>packet capture
library (libpcap)</em></a>.
<dt>
<b>Limitations</b>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Tcpdpriv</em> currently only works on SunOS, Solaris, and FreeBSD
systems.  While it should port to other systems fairly easily, there
have been problems reported porting to Digital Unix running on Alpha
processors; this and other portability problems will hopefully be fixed
in future releases (send diffs!).
<li>
Link-level headers are passed through unchanged.
<li>
<em>Tcpdpriv</em> should probably preserve the all-zeroes and all-ones
addresses.
<li>
It would be nice if <em>tcpdpriv</em> could retain subnet
broadcast information.
<li>
The <i>-A50</i> option can be a security concern for some sites (but
it probably not a concern for most sites).  A short
<a href=attack50/attack50.html>analysis</a>
of the
security issues with the <i>-A50</i> option is available.
